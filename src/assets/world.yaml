  RFOYER: |
    You are in the foyer of the farmhouse. The peeling paint and threadbare rugs
    make it seem older than the outside of the house.
    A large dollhouse sits on a pedestal in the far corner of the room.
  FFIRE1: |
    A massive stone fireplace. Above it hangs a portrait of a woman with long,
    straight black hair. She has one hand on her visibly pregnant belly.
    The embers are cold.
  RDRAW: |
    You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture.
    The room smells of musty upholstery.
  FFIRE2: |
    An impressive granite fireplace. Above the mantle hangs a brightly colored
    painting of a newborn, out of place in such a drab room.
    The embers are cold.
  FFIRE3: |
    Above a brick-and-onyx fireplace hangs a dreadful painting of a small child
    being devoured whole by a tall, dimly-lit creature. It is hard to look at.
    The embers are cold.
  RSTUDY: |
    A nice old room.
    What a nice place it is.
    Fuck it.
  RFROG: |
    You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture. The room smells of musty upholstery.
    Oh god this is going to be such a long description, isn't it?
  FPLANT: |
    A nice looking plant.

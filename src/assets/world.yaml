# There are two invisible "breakpoints" -- for strings to look good, they should

strings:
  $D_DINING: |
    The lock is broken and the door won't budge. With the right tool, you can
    probably pry it open.
  $D_DINING_OPEN: |
    You wedge the knife between the door and frame. With a little effort, you
    force the broken lock away from the strike plate.
    %y%0 You push the door open.
  $D_FOYER: |
    The front door has jammed behind you and won't budge.
  $D_GARAGED: |
    The garage door is heavy and immobile. In the center of the door is
    a spray-painted eye, surrounded by rings of tiny symbols. It's hard
    to breathe in this room, it's too small somehow.
  $D_KITCHEN: |
    It seems to be locked from the other side.
  $F_BURNT_CHAIR: |
    The charred remnants of a rocking chair.
    A half-burnt notebook is resting on the melted seat cushion.
  $F_BURNT_CHAIR_A: |
    The charred remnants of a rocking chair.
  $F_FIRE1: |
    A massive stone fireplace. Above it hangs a portrait of a woman with long,
    straight black hair. She has one hand on her visibly pregnant belly.
    The embers are cold.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE: |
    A vintage dollhouse. Normally you could open it up and take a look inside,
    but it's been locked with a small silver padlock.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_A: |
    You carefully unlock the padlock and swing the dollhouse open. Eerily, it
    seems to be a miniature version of the house you stand in. Even the
    furniture is in the same locations.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_B: |
    The open dollhouse watches you impatiently.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_C: |
    The miniature workbench fits perfectly into a space in the garage. The
    dollhouse accepts your gift eagerly.
  $F_DRAWER1: |
    A small dresser-drawer is sitting in the corner.
    A small silver key is lying on top, attached to note.
  $F_DRAWER1_A: |
    A small dresser-drawer is sitting in the corner.
  $F_GRAFFITI: |
    The wall is strangely spongy here, more like moss than wallpaper.
    The phrase "HER CHILDREN" has been spray-painted across the wall.
  $F_SHELF1: |
    A rusty garage shelf.
  $F_SHELF2: |
    The shelf is covered with dust, but not much else.
  $F_SHELF3: |
    Someone has touched this shelf recently, the dust is noticeably absent.
    A realistic miniature workbench rests on the shelf.
  $F_SHELF3_A: |
    The shelf seems to have been recently used, most of the dust is wiped off.
  $F_FIRE2: |
    An impressive granite fireplace. Above the mantle hangs a brightly colored
    painting of a newborn, out of place in such a drab room.
    The embers are cold.
  $F_FIRE3: |
    Above a brick-and-onyx hearth hangs an unpleasant painting of a small child
    being devoured whole by a tall, dimly-lit creature. It is hard to look at.
    A knife has been left jammed into the canvas. You can probably pull it out.
  $F_FIRE3_A: |
    With a tug, the painting releases a long iron knife. Hundreds of tiny
    symbols have been etched up and down the blade, but you don't recognize them.
    %y%0 You have obtained iron knife.
  $F_FIRE3_B: |
    Above a brick-and-onyx hearth hangs an unpleasant painting of a small child
    being devoured whole by a tall, dimly-lit creature. It is hard to look at.
    The embers are cold.
  $F_STAIR1: |
    The stairs to the second floor are a wreck - you can't go up this way.
  $F_STATUE: |
    A crude, life-sized sculpture of a pregnant woman. One hand rests on her
    belly, and the other holds an iron knife.
    The sculpture's grip looks loose - perhaps you could take the knife.
  $F_STATUE_A: |
    With a tug, the sculpture releases the knife.
    %y%0 You have obtained iron knife.
  $F_STATUE_B: |

    - |
      A large iron knife etched with
      hundreds of tiny symbols. It feels
      heavy in your hand.
  $I_BURNT_NOTEBOOK:
    - half-burnt notebook
    - |
      Most of the pages are too burnt
      to read, but somehow one page
      is crystal clear:

      "Our Goddess walks the hills
       in the shadow of the wailing star
       and we follow in her path"
  $I_DOLL_WORKBENCH:
    - miniature workbench
    - |
      A curiously realistic miniature
      workbench, made of wood and metal.
      Maybe there's some use for it.
  $I_SILVER_KEY:
    - small silver key
    - |
      A small silver key. A note is
      attached with a piece of twine.

       We are all in grave danger and
       I am running out of time. I
       cannot explain here but I need
       your help."
      [Several more lines are furiously
      crossed out and are illegible.]
  $R_FOYER:
    - FOYER
    - |
      You are in the foyer of the farmhouse. The peeling paint and threadbare
      rugs make it seem older than the outside of the house.
      A large dollhouse sits on a pedestal in the far corner of the room.
  $R_DINING:
    - DINING ROOM
    - |
      The dining room is dominated by an oak table, which appears to have been
      used recently as a butcher's block. Flies buzz above fresh animal entrails
      littering the table. The table and the carpet below is soaked in blood.
  $R_DRAW:
    - DRAWING ROOM
    - |
      You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture.
      The room smells of musty upholstery.
  $R_GARAGE:
    - GARAGE
    - |
      The garage is empty, save for a few rusty shelves and the usual cobwebs.
      There must have been other furniture here recently, you can see lines
      in the dust where a workbench used to be.
  $R_HALLWAY:
    - CHARRED HALLWAY
    - |
      There must have been a fire at some point. Soot and grime coat the walls,
      and the air stinks of burnt fabric.
  $R_STUDY:
    - ???
    - |
      A nice old room.
      What a nice place it is.
      Fuck it.

# There are two invisible "breakpoints" -- for strings to look good, they should

  $D_CLOSET_OPEN: |
    You unscrew several screws and the metal plate clatters to the floor.
    %y%0 You push the door open.
  $D_DINING: |
    The lock is broken and the door won't budge. With the right tool, you can
    probably pry it open.

    %y%0 You push the door open.
  $D_FOYER: |

  $D_GARAGED: |
    The garage door is heavy and immobile. In the center of the door is
    a spray-painted eye, surrounded by rings of tiny symbols. It's hard
    to breathe in this room, it's too small somehow.
  $D_KITCHEN: |
    It seems to be locked from the other side.
  $F_BURNT_CHAIR: |
    The charred remnants of a rocking chair.
    A half-burnt notebook is resting on the melted seat cushion.

    The charred remnants of a rocking chair.
  $F_CHAIR1: |
    This chair is covered in mildew, but otherwise uninteresting.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE: |
    A vintage dollhouse. Normally you could open it up and take a look inside,
    but it's been locked with a small silver padlock.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_A: |
    You carefully unlock the padlock and swing the dollhouse open. Eerily, it
    seems to be a miniature version of the house you stand in. Even the
    furniture is in the same locations.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_B: |
    The open dollhouse watches you impatiently.
  $F_DOLLHOUSE_C: |
    The miniature workbench fits perfectly into a space in the garage. The

  $F_DRAWER1_A: |
    A small dresser-drawer is sitting in the corner.
  $F_GRAFFITI: |
    The wall is strangely spongy here, more like moss than wallpaper.
    The phrase "HER CHILDREN" has been spray-painted across the wall.
  $F_PAINTING1: |
    An oil painting hangs on the wall, out of place in this shabby room. It
    seems to depict a planet being devoured by... something.
    You feel that the less you look at it, the better.
  $F_SHELF1: |
    A rusty garage shelf.
  $F_SHELF2: |
    The shelf is covered with dust, but not much else.

  $F_SHELF4: |
    The shelf is covered with dust, but not much else.

    feathers hang from every corner and crevice.

  $F_STAIR1: |
    The stairs to the second floor are a wreck - you can't go up this way.
  $F_STATUE: |
    A crude, life-sized sculpture of a pregnant woman. One hand rests on her
    belly, and the other holds an iron knife.
    The sculpture's grip looks loose - perhaps you could take the knife.
  $F_STATUE_A: |
    With a tug, the sculpture releases the knife.
    %y%0 You have obtained iron knife.
  $F_STATUE_B: |
    A crude, life-sized sculpture of a pregnant woman. One hand rests on her
    belly.
  $I_IRON_KNIFE:
    - iron knife
    - |
      A large iron knife etched with
      hundreds of tiny symbols. It feels
      heavy in your hand.
  $I_BURNT_NOTEBOOK:
    - half-burnt notebook
    - |
      Most of the pages are too burnt
      to read, but somehow one page
      is crystal clear:

      "Our Goddess walks the hills
       in the shadow of the wailing star
       and we follow in her path"
  $I_DOLL_WORKBENCH:
    - miniature workbench
    - |
      A curiously realistic miniature
      workbench, made of wood and metal.

      A rusty, but still functional,
      crosshead screwdriver.

    - your uncle's letter
    - |
      "Dearest Emily,

       We are all in grave danger and
       I am running out of time. I
       cannot explain here but I need
       your help."
      [Several more lines are furiously
      crossed out and are illegible.]
  $R_CLOSET:
    - STORAGE CLOSET
    - |
      This storage closet has been converted into some kind of shrine. The
      unpainted wooden walls are carved with words, but none of them make
      any sense to you.
  $R_DINING:
    - DINING ROOM
    - |
      The dining room is dominated by an oak table, which appears to have been
      used recently as a butcher's block. Flies buzz above fresh animal entrails
      littering the table. The table and the carpet below is soaked in blood.
  $R_DRAW:
    - DRAWING ROOM
    - |
      You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture.
      The room smells of musty upholstery.
  $R_FOYER:
    - FOYER
    - |
      You are in the foyer. The peeling paint and threadbare rugs seem even
      older than the outside of the house.
      A large dollhouse sits on a pedestal in the far corner of the room.
  $R_GARAGE:
    - GARAGE
    - |
      The garage is empty, save for a few rusty shelves and the usual cobwebs.
      There must have been other furniture here recently, you can see lines
      in the dust where a workbench used to be.
  $R_HALLWAY:
    - CHARRED HALLWAY
    - |
      There must have been a fire at some point. Soot and grime coat the walls,
      and the air stinks of burnt fabric.
  $R_STUDY:
    - ???
    - |
      A nice old room.
      What a nice place it is.
      Fuck it.

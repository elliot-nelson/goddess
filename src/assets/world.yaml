  $RFOYER: |
    You are in the foyer of the farmhouse. The peeling paint and threadbare
    rugs make it seem older than the outside of the house.
    A large dollhouse sits on a pedestal in the far corner of the room.
  $FFIRE1: |
    A massive stone fireplace. Above it hangs a portrait of a woman with long,
    straight black hair. She has one hand on her visibly pregnant belly.
    The embers are cold.
  $FDOLLHOUSE: |
    A vintage dollhouse. Normally you could open it up and take a look inside,
    but it's been locked with a small silver padlock.
  $FDOLLHOUSE_A: |
    You need some kind of key to open this.
  $RDRAW: |
    You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture.
    The room smells of musty upholstery.
  $FFIRE2: |
    An impressive granite fireplace. Above the mantle hangs a brightly colored
    painting of a newborn, out of place in such a drab room.
    The embers are cold.
  $FFIRE3: |
    Above a brick-and-onyx hearth hangs an unpleasant painting of a small child
    being devoured whole by a tall, dimly-lit creature. It is hard to look at.
    A knife has been left jammed into the canvas. You can probably pull it out.
  $FFIRE3_A: |
    With a tug, the painting releases a long iron knife. Hundreds of tiny
    symbols have been etched up and down the blade, but you don't recognize them.
    %y\xa5 You have obtained iron knife.
  $FFIRE3_B: |
    Above a brick-and-onyx hearth hangs an unpleasant painting of a small child
    being devoured whole by a tall, dimly-lit creature. It is hard to look at.
    The embers are cold.
  $RSTUDY: |
    A nice old room.
    What a nice place it is.
    Fuck it.
  $RFROG: |
    You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture. The room smells of musty upholstery.
    Oh god this is going to be such a long description, isn't it?
  $FPLANT: |
    A nice looking plant.

    You are in the foyer of the farmhouse. The peeling paint and threadbare rugs
    make it seem older than the outside of the house.
    A large dollhouse sits on a pedestal in the far corner of the room.

    You are in a dimly lit drawing room filled with faded furniture.
    The room smells of musty upholstery.

    An impressive granite fireplace. Above the mantle hangs a brightly colored
    portrait of a newborn, out of place in such a drab room.
    The embers are cold.
  RSTUDY: |
    A nice old room.
    What a nice place it is.
    Fuck it.
